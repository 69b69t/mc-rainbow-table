this is kinda 3 repos in a trenchcoat

# mc-rainbow-table
attempts to reverse the seed hash sent the the minecraft client on server join

compile with `nvcc sha256.cuh seedhash.cu -o seedHash`



# rainbowAttack
files in the "rainbowAttack" directory are currently plain c, but will most likely be cuda'd soon(tm)

compile those with `gcc sha256.c rainbowAttack.c -o rainbowAttack -Ofast`

oh, and dont forget your rainbow tables!



# sortDb
the tables originally generated by mc-rainbow-table are sorted by their input, not their hash. this is useless for binary searching so we have to fix that

compile with `gcc sortDb.c -o sortDb`. this sorts in memory so it eats a ton of ram if your table is large. good luck
